Git init
Git init creates a new empty repository in a chosen directory or initialize an existing directory as a git repository. When you run it, it sets up git’s infrastructure and data structures to keep track of changes.
Syntax: git init
 
 
(This would be a hidden folder but if this shows up you know it worked)
 
Git status
Status displays information about the current state of the working directory and git repository. Shows which files have been modified and which ones are ready to be commit.
Syntax: git status
 

 
Git add
Git add command is used to add any staged changes in the working directory to be added into the next commit point.
Syntax: git add <filenamehere>
 
When you check the status again it should show the changes to be committed.
