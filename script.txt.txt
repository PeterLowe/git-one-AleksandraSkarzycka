Git Guide – Aleksandra Skarzycka
Git init + remote
Git init initializes a repository in a chosen directory, git remote adds an upstream repository 
   
 
Git status + add
Status shows the files in the branch that are “dirty” or clean, add adds them to the branch which will let them be included in the next commit
 
 
Git commit
Commit creates a snapshot of the staged changes made, saves your changes to a local repository
 
 
Git remote
Lets you view the repositories in a list with a URL
