Git init
Git init creates a new empty repository in a chosen directory or initialize an existing directory as a git repository. When you run it, it sets up git’s infrastructure and data structures to keep track of changes.
Syntax: git init
 
 
(This would be a hidden folder but if this shows up you know it worked)
 
Git status
Status displays information about the current state of the working directory and git repository. Shows which files have been modified and which ones are ready to be commit.
Syntax: git status
 

 
Git add
Git add command is used to add any staged changes in the working directory to be added into the next commit point.
Syntax: git add <filenamehere>
 
When you check the status again it should show the changes to be committed.
 
Git commit
Git commit creates a snapshot of the staged changes made, saves your changes to a local repository. You must specifically tell git which files you want to include before you commit, or else it won’t save them.
Syntax: git commit -m “your message here”
 
 
Git remote
Git remote lets you create, view, and delete connections to other repositories, accompanied by their URL. Remote connections are like bookmarks rather than direct links that let you access different repositories.
Syntax: git remote -v (this lists the repositories).
 
 
Git branch
Branches are used to list, create, delete, and manage branches in a git repository. Separate lines to work on different features.
Syntax: git branch <branch_name> (creates branches), git branch (lists all branches)
